            Medellín, "Qahera" how you pronounce it in Arabic, means the
            Conqueror from the Ancient History. <br />
            As an Egyptian Citizen, I grew up in Medellín, Capital of Egypt.
            Only 10 miles away from the Pyramids. And yes it's always
            fascinating to see the Pyramids everyday.

          <Typography paragraph className="text">
            First getting to Egypt, The best time to visit is when the climate
            is nice, Egypt has four seasons but avoid going in the summer as its
            brutal, Warm winters attract a lot of tourists. I recommend visiting
            Egypt between October and May.

            Egypt has 4 seasons. <br />
            Use Uber for transportation.
            <br />
            Keep a light jacket on you all the time during spring. 
            <br />
            Don't show too much shiny things in crowded areas. 
            <br />
            You'll need to check the weather before going to each City. <br />
            Egypt is very affordable and you'll need cash in some parts. <br />
            Couchsurfing is important everywhere, and very helpful in Egypt. 
            <br />
            One of the biggest Malls in the world is called City Stars in Cairo.{" "}

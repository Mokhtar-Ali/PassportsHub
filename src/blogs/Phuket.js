            From the moment I landed, I was welcomed and greeted with beautiful
            smiles from everyone. So much positive energy in this place! Even
            the customs officers were smiling which never happened in any other
            country. <br />
            Sawadee "hello" in Thai with a little bow from every single person
            in Thailand. I decided to start the vacation with Phuket, the
            biggest island in Thailand for one week and it was the best week of
            my life. <br />
            <hr />
            I stayed in a hotel by Patong Beach where there are a varaity of
            good restaurants and nightlife. If you like Thai food you will be in
            heaven, the spices are rich and everything is fresh and everything
            is very affordable here. <br />
            Food carts in the streets were very tasty and healthy. <br />
            Phuket's main income is Tourism so people are very friendly and
            welcoming and it's safe everywhere. <br />
            You don't need to stress planning anything in Thailand, as
            everything could be arranged and booked through activity booths or
            you can arrange it through your hotel. <br />
            <hr />
            <img src={PhiPhi} className="image-in-blog" alt="Phi Phi island" />
            <hr />
            I have enjoyed different activities for a very reasonable price
            including: diving, scuba diving, taking a boat to James Bond Island
            and 4 other islands. Tigers Land, Elephant Land, KickBoxing fight
            and visiting Temples.
            <br />
            Make sure you don't miss any of these experiences as they were
            amazing! <br />
            Don't miss trying a Thai massage, they will break your bones but you
            will feel awesome after. It is the only Country I've ever been that
            had everything I wanted in a vacation. People, food, beauty,
            beaches, animals, diversity, sports.

            <h5 style={{ textAlign: "center" }}>Overall</h5>
            Night life in Phuket is amazing.
            <br />
            Everything is affordable wherever you go.
            <br />
            Thailand is a very happy place and people have a lot of good
            qualities. <br />
            Best time to visit is between October and April as the weather is
            80s or low 90s.
            <br />
            If you are to visit Bangkok try not to stay more than 3 days and
            check the Temples and the floating markets. <br />

          From my hotel window and eveywhere you go in Quito, Your view will

            As far as I know, Ecuadorian people are humble and hardworking, very
            serious but very welcoming. <br />
            This judgment is based on living among them in the USA. The plan is
            to stay 2 weeks in Ecuador. 1 week in Quito and another in
            Guayaquil. Around 10 pm we landed in Quito Airport, in a city that
            is 9350 ft above sea level. <br />
            Quito is a ghost town on a Sunday night. Our driver who is our
            Airbnb host, literally drove us all over town to look for a
            restaurant or a deli for a whole hour to eat something. At the end,
            we found one, the only 24/hour restaurant in the city. And it was
            worth it as the food was delicious. Tasted like homemade 
            Temperature is 50 degrees in the night. Cold enough to wear a jacket
            in August.

            Next day, its 10 am, The view from my Airbnb window was fascinating,
            Volcanos and mountains everywhere! we head out for an Ecuadorian
            breakfast. Walking through the streets of Quito was pleasant as the
            streets are beautiful and clean while roads are full of hills so
            it's also a sport. <br />
            Breakfast in Ecuador is very delicious as I spent 2 weeks eating the
            same thing for breakfast 'Humita' an Ecuadorian dish of mashed corn
            and cheese covered with corn Leafs and baked until perfection. The
            food is very natural here they depend on corn, flower, banana,
            cheese, and rice in almost every meal. Everyone is humble and sweet.
            greeting each other 'Buenos dias'. Everyone lives in peace.  People
            in Quito dress up nice even if they are going to the supermarket,
            even though a lot of them are poor. But they are hard working.
            Ecuadorian in Quito are very family oriented and religious.

            Then we head to the Middle of the Earth. One hour Uber ride, where
            the sun is staring at you, because of the cool Temperature you may
            not feel it, but becareful not to get a sun strike. There is a
            museum that shows the process of discovering the equator and how
            they build the structure to represent it. There is a cool point
            there where you are zero feet from North and South!! Later We took
            the 'Teleferico' a cableway to the top of the highest mountains,
            which was a pleasant ride, at this point the highest mountain in
            Quito that we reached was 5600 meters, that's 18,372 feets above sea
            level. From there, Oxygin level is low, but the view is
            breathtaking. After we took the cable back down.

            Food in Ecuador is super delicious, and if you like seafood, you are
            in heaven. In the image above a bowl of 'Cevici'. Healthy, delicious
            and boosts your stamina to keep hiking in Ecuador. One of the
            nights, we went to The Old downtown. 'Calle Ronda' a beautiful old
            street in old downtown. Full of Restaurants, clubs and cafes. I had
            the biggest empanada there, about 2 feets wide!!!! ofcourse not by
            myself lol. For the rest of my week. I went to a beautiful town
            called Baños that is 3 hours away from Quito by bus. One of the most
            beautiful places I've been in my life! Stay toned for the next Blog
            about Baños Ecuador!

            about Quito.
            <br />
            Altitude pills is a must in Ecuador.
            <br />
            Coffee in Ecuador is delicious. <br />
            Keep a light jacket on you all the time. 
            <br />
            The weather is very unpredictable in Quito because of its altitude.
            <br />
            Quito is very safe and clean, But like every country you will see on
            my blog, I wouldn't recommend wearing shinny stuff. <br />
            Stay toned for another blog coming for the rest of my week in Quito
            in a beautiful town called Baños.
